##BAN QUERY

This query was intended to be an automated ban script. It is an accumulation of all behavior that I have considered to be exploitative.

##BAN QUERY - already warned

This pulls users who have already been warned through Zendesk. Using Zendesk's user_issue tag, I can find if the user continued to exploit after the date the warning was issued.
