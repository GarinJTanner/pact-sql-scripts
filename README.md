# Pact, Inc. 
Pact (originally GymPact) was an app that incentivized workouts and healthy eating habits with real money. For every activity you complete, you earn cash. For each activity you don't complete, you pay toward other people's pacts.

This is a repository of the fraud detection and quality assurance scripts that I had created while working for the company. The company no longer exists as it shutdown in 2017.
